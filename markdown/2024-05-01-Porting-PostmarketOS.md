# Porting PostmarketOS to the samsung galaxy tab A 10.5
At the time of writing, May 2025, it was summer of last year when i embarked on this project. 

Of course i could've never done this without help from more experienced people:
[NSG650](https://nsg650.github.io/) and [blank]().  

That said, let's get to the point. Last year i acquired a samsung tablet, scouring for custom ROMs for this tablet on the internet showed not many people
showed love for this tablet, all i found was a [LineageOS port](https://xdaforums.com/t/rom-unofficial-15-qpr2-lineageos-22-2-64-bit-for-galaxy-tab-a-10-5-2018-wifi-sm-t590.4427597/)
that had not been updated since 2022.  
Being it was summer and i was fairly bored, my initial intent was to port TWRP to it but i found it quite frustrating from my inexperienced pov at the time, upon suggestion i 
looked up the [PostmarketOS porting guide](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Porting_to_a_new_device/Initialization)...
