## schematic of 858D
Here's a part of the schematic i've figured out from looking at the pcb of this 858D hot air station i got off amazon for 40 bucks.
## teardown
Here's the photo from the listing on amazon:

It looks pretty much the same irl, here's the inside

It has a transformer that outputs 29 and 10V, to drive the fan and logic circuit.
And this is the main logic board:

The inside of the heat gun has this small board connecting everything with different colours and breaking it out to connectors that go on the logic board

These 3 connectors are in order:Live and Neutral in, transformer primary winding wires, heat gun resistor leads

The main MCU is designed my sino mcu in china, thankfully i found the datasheet [here](https://www.sinomcu.com/upload/serviceSupport/serviceFile/usermanual/MC51F003A4%E7%94%A8%E6%88%B7%E6%89%8B%E5%86%8CV1.4.pdf)
